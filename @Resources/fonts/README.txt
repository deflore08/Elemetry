In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium. From dumpy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but up. Bungee is a font family that celebrates urban signage. It wrangles the Latin alphabet to work vertically as well as horizontally.

Thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee is released under the SIL Open Font License.

As a display superfamily, 5 variations are available:

*   [Bungee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee)
*   Bungee Hairline
*   [Bungee Inline](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Inline)
*   [Bungee Outline](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Outline)
*   [Bungee Shade](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Shade)
